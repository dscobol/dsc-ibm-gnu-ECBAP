# Extras

## Directory Structure:

This is the directory structure use to create, compile and run these programs.
```
.
├── bin
├── cbl
├── cpy
├── data
├── jcl
├── outdata
├── spool
```

The bin, outdata, and spool directories are not present as they are excluded by the .gitignore file.

## Running the examples:

Create the missing directories:
```
mkdir bin outdata spool
```

CD into the jcl directory.

These "jobs" are "compile, link and go" scripts.

## NOTE: Some programs are not runnable.

Some of the programs are the original programs that were used as a starting program or as a "Read to Learn" example.

They have not been modified to run using GnuCOBOL.

Some of the programs use Functions that are not available in GnuCOBOL. They were run on the Mainframe.
