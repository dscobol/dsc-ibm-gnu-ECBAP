# dsc-ibm-gnu-ECBAP

This is a collection of:
- COBOL programs
- Compiled by the GnuCOBOL compiler
- Run on a Gnu/Linux OS(Pop!_OS).
- Originally created for [Enterprise COBOL For Business Application Programming](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/viewdocument/enterprise-cobol-for-business-appli?CommunityKey=b0dae4a8-74eb-44ac-86c7-90f3cd32909a&tab=librarydocuments) class.

This is more of an archive but I wanted to convert them to document the differences between running them on a Mainframe vs Gnu/Linux.

Spoiler Alert: **Very little needs to be done.**.
